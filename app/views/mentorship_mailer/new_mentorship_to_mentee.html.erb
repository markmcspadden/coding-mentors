Hey <%= @receiver.name %>,

<%= @sender.name %> would like to mentor you in <%= @skills %>.

<% unless @mentorship.sender_note.blank? -%>
<%= @sender.name %> also wanted to include the following note:
<blockquote>
<%= @mentorship.sender_note %>
</blockquote>
<% end -%>

Head on over to <%= respond_mentorship_url(@mentorship) %> to let <%= @sender.name %> know if you're interested.

Thanks!
