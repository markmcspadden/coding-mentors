Hey <%= @receiver.name %>,

<%= @sender.name %> will not be available to mentor you in <%= @skills %>.

<% unless @mentorship.receiver_note.blank? -%>
<%= @sender.name %> did want to pass along this note:
<blockquote>
I'm really swamped this month. Maybe next month?
</blockquote>
<% end -%>

We encourage you to keep looking for an apprentice and are more than happy to help in any way that we can.
