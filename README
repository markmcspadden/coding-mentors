== Welcome to Coding Mentors

That's what we are and that's what we're doing. Feel free to jump in and help out.

== Installation

=== SITE KEY FOR SALTED/HASHED PASSWORDS

* Create config/initializers/site_keys_dev.rb OR config/initializers/site_keys_pro.rb based off of config/initializers/site_keys.rb
* Change KEY in your new site_keys_xxx.rb
 
=== RECAPTCHA

* Create a global key at recaptcha.net. (You can tie the key to a domain if you'd like, but global is easiest to get up and running)
* Create config/initializers/recaptcha_dev.rb OR config/initializers/recaptcha_pro.rb based off of config/initializers/recaptcha.rb
* Change KEY in your new recaptcha_xxx.rb to match your public and private key from RECAPTCHA
