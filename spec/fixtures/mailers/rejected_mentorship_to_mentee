  Hey Mark McSpadden,
</p>

<p>
  Dave Kruse will not be available to mentor you in Ruby on Rails, Ruby, and Metaprogramming.
</p>

<p>
  Dave Kruse did want to pass along this note:
</p>
<blockquote>
  I'm really swamped this month. Maybe next month?
</blockquote>

<p>
  We encourage you to keep looking for an apprentice and are more than happy to help in any way that we can.
</p>
