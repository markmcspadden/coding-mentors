Hey Dave Kruse,

Mark McSpadden will not be available to be your apprentice in Ruby on Rails, Ruby, and Metaprogramming.

Mark McSpadden did want to pass along this note:
<blockquote>
I'm really swamped this month. Maybe next month?
</blockquote>

We encourage you to keep looking for an apprentice and are more than happy to help in any way that we can.
